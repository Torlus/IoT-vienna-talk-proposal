# Title

Identity, Security and Privacy in the IoT era.

# Abstract

> The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect -- to help people work together -- and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into families, associations, and companies. We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner.

*Tim Berners-Lee, "Weaving the Web"*

> I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy
privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the
world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly
building.

*Edward Snowden*

Identity, Security and Privacy are still some of the main subjects of worry with Internet as we know it. Forseeing it populated with millions of connected low-end hardware devices, where security will be traded-off for efficiency raises even more major concerns.

However, Security, which is the foundation upon which Identity and Privacy can be enforced, as it is more a state of mind and a set of good practices and education, than a technical challenge.

Shamelessly stolen on the Internet. I will propose something different if you're not happy with it.

# Latest talk

It is in French, but it is also:
- The latest one.
- The one I am the least ashamed of
- One of the few that had the chance of getting a decent recording, apart from the "ssssshh" noise of the ill-tuned microphone, at the beginning of the talk.
